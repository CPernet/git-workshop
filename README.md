# Git workshop exercises

All workshop participants are split over multiple groups. Please identify your group mebers ...

Make sure that you have a git client installed and clone this repository to your local computer.

# Exercise 1

We have a separate directory for each group.

Please write a markdown file with short **introduction** about yourself. For example, what food do you like.

Save it with your name or your pseudonym like `yourname.md`, and add it to the directory that corresponds to your group.

Pull, Commit, Push and Pull to add your introduction - and also to get the introductions of the others.

#  Exercise 2

In each group directory there is a `README.md` file in which we want to collect recommendations of movies and/or TV shows.

Pull the latest changes to your local repository, edit the README and add your recommendation.

Commit and push...

As you are all doing this at (more or less) the same time, it is very likely that there will be merge conflicts and that chaos will ensue... breathe in and breathe out, and let's try to work these out together. Collaborating and social coding is not only about jointly contributing to a repository, but also on making agreements on the workflow. Who does what, in what order, and who takes responsibility.

#  Exercise 3

Create an [issue](https://github.com/Donders-Institute/git-workshop/issues) for one of your group members, for example ask them to add or modify a file. Assign a label to the issue and assign it to the group member that should resolve it.

Working together while not sitting next to each other (and possibly in different time zones) requires good communication. You can discuss the issue online: every comment that is added to the issue will result in an email. Other repository (aka team) members can also read along.
